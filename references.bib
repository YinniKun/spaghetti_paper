However, widely used clustering and visualization algorithms produce a fixed number of cell clusters. A fixed clustering ‘resolution’ hampers our ability to identify and visualize echelons of cell states. We developed TooManyCells, a suite of graph-based algorithms for efficient and unbiased identification and visualization of cell clades. TooManyCells introduces a visualization model built on a concept intentionally orthogonal to dimensionality-reduction methods. TooManyCells is also equipped with an efficient matrix-free divisive hierarchical spectral clustering different from prevalent single-resolution clustering methods. TooManyCells enables multiresolution and multifaceted exploration of single-cell clades. An advantage of this paradigm is the immediate detection of rare and common populations that outperforms popular clustering and visualization algorithms, as demonstrated using existing single-cell transcriptomic data sets and new data modeling drug-resistance acquisition in leukemic T cells.}, note={Citation Key: schwartzTooManyCellsIdentifiesVisualizes2020}, number={44}, journal={Nature Methods}, publisher={Nature Publishing Group}, author={Schwartz, Gregory W. and Zhou, Yeqiao and Petrovic, Jelena and Fasolino, Maria and Xu, Lanwei and Shaffer, Sydney M. and Pear, Warren S. and Vahedi, Golnaz and Faryabi, Robert B.}, year={2020}, month=apr, pages={405–413}, language={en} }

  abstract     = {Id proteins are inhibitors of basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors and generally stimulate cell proliferation and inhibit differentiation. We have shown that ectopic expression of Id-1 in murine mammary epithelial cells resulted in loss of differentiation and gain of invasive and proliferative abilities. Moreover, Id-1 was highly expressed in aggressive breast cancer cells in culture and in biopsies from infiltrating carcinomas. In contrast to Id-1, we found that, in vitro and in vivo, Id-2 {mRNA} and protein were up-regulated as mammary epithelial cells lost proliferative capacity and initiated differentiation. We further determined that this up-regulation of Id-2 was a necessary step toward a fully differentiated phenotype in breast cells. Here we show that one of the components of the extracellular matrix network, laminin, is responsible for the increase in Id-2 expression during differentiation. We also show that Id-2 expression is inversely correlated with the rate of proliferation in murine mammary epithelial cells and that Id-2 is expressed at a higher level in differentiated human breast cancer cells in comparison with very aggressive and metastatic cells. When reintroduced in aggressive breast cancer cells, Id-2 is able to reduce their proliferative and invasive phenotypes and decrease their level of matrix metalloproteinase 9 secretion as well as increase syndecan-1 expression. Moreover, little Id-2 protein expression is detectable in human biopsies from aggressive and invasive carcinomas in comparison with in situ carcinomas. In conclusion, Id-2 expression not only follows a pattern opposite to that of Id-1 during mammary gland development and breast cancer progression but also appears to act as an important protein for the maintenance of a differentiated and noninvasive phenotype in normal and transformed breast cells.},

  abstract     = {{ID} proteins have been implicated in the regulation of cell proliferation and differentiation in various cell types during normal development as well as in the formation of cancer. Our aim was to delineate the expression of {ID}2 by immunohistochemistry in primary breast cancer in order to detect potential associations with cell cycle regulatory proteins and/or clinicopathologic parameters. We further overexpressed {ID}2 in a breast cancer cell line to elaborate potential effects on proliferation and invasiveness. We observed large variations in {ID}2 expression in primary breast cancer, and the protein was localised to both the nucleus and cytoplasm. Interestingly, a high cytoplasmic {ID}2 protein level correlated with a favourable prognosis. Overexpressing {ID}2 in the {MDA}-{MB}-468 breast cancer cell line generated a marked cytoplasmic localisation of the protein and reduced the invasive capacity of cells. Modest enhancement of cell proliferation was further detected in {ID}2-overexpressing cells. In conclusion, {ID}2 protein expression varies substantially within primary breast tumours and high cytoplasmic levels of {ID}2 might reflect a less aggressive breast tumour phenotype. © 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

abstract={Light microscopy combined with well-established protocols of two-dimensional cell culture facilitates high-throughput quantitative imaging to study biological phenomena. Accurate segmentation of individual cells in images enables exploration of complex biological questions, but can require sophisticated imaging processing pipelines in cases of low contrast and high object density. Deep learning-based methods are considered state-of-the-art for image segmentation but typically require vast amounts of annotated data, for which there is no suitable resource available in the field of label-free cellular imaging. Here, we present LIVECell, a large, high-quality, manually annotated and expert-validated dataset of phase-contrast images, consisting of over 1.6 million cells from a diverse set of cell morphologies and culture densities. To further demonstrate its use, we train convolutional neural network-based models using LIVECell and evaluate model segmentation accuracy with a proposed a suite of benchmarks.},

	abstract = {Generalist methods for cellular segmentation have good out-of-the-box performance on a variety of image types. However, existing methods struggle for images that are degraded by noise, blurred or undersampled, all of which are common in microscopy. We focused the development of Cellpose3 on addressing these cases, and here we demonstrate substantial out-of-the-box gains in segmentation and image quality for noisy, blurry or undersampled images. Unlike previous approaches, which train models to restore pixel values, we trained Cellpose3 to output images that are well-segmented by a generalist segmentation model, while maintaining perceptual similarity to the target images. Furthermore, we trained the restoration models on a large, varied collection of datasets, thus ensuring good generalization to user images. We provide these tools as {\textquotedblleft}one-click{\textquotedblright} buttons inside the graphical interface of Cellpose as well as in the Cellpose API.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},
