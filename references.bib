However, widely used clustering and visualization algorithms produce a fixed number of cell clusters. A fixed clustering ‘resolution’ hampers our ability to identify and visualize echelons of cell states. We developed TooManyCells, a suite of graph-based algorithms for efficient and unbiased identification and visualization of cell clades. TooManyCells introduces a visualization model built on a concept intentionally orthogonal to dimensionality-reduction methods. TooManyCells is also equipped with an efficient matrix-free divisive hierarchical spectral clustering different from prevalent single-resolution clustering methods. TooManyCells enables multiresolution and multifaceted exploration of single-cell clades. An advantage of this paradigm is the immediate detection of rare and common populations that outperforms popular clustering and visualization algorithms, as demonstrated using existing single-cell transcriptomic data sets and new data modeling drug-resistance acquisition in leukemic T cells.}, note={Citation Key: schwartzTooManyCellsIdentifiesVisualizes2020}, number={44}, journal={Nature Methods}, publisher={Nature Publishing Group}, author={Schwartz, Gregory W. and Zhou, Yeqiao and Petrovic, Jelena and Fasolino, Maria and Xu, Lanwei and Shaffer, Sydney M. and Pear, Warren S. and Vahedi, Golnaz and Faryabi, Robert B.}, year={2020}, month=apr, pages={405–413}, language={en} }

  abstract     = {Id proteins are inhibitors of basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors and generally stimulate cell proliferation and inhibit differentiation. We have shown that ectopic expression of Id-1 in murine mammary epithelial cells resulted in loss of differentiation and gain of invasive and proliferative abilities. Moreover, Id-1 was highly expressed in aggressive breast cancer cells in culture and in biopsies from infiltrating carcinomas. In contrast to Id-1, we found that, in vitro and in vivo, Id-2 {mRNA} and protein were up-regulated as mammary epithelial cells lost proliferative capacity and initiated differentiation. We further determined that this up-regulation of Id-2 was a necessary step toward a fully differentiated phenotype in breast cells. Here we show that one of the components of the extracellular matrix network, laminin, is responsible for the increase in Id-2 expression during differentiation. We also show that Id-2 expression is inversely correlated with the rate of proliferation in murine mammary epithelial cells and that Id-2 is expressed at a higher level in differentiated human breast cancer cells in comparison with very aggressive and metastatic cells. When reintroduced in aggressive breast cancer cells, Id-2 is able to reduce their proliferative and invasive phenotypes and decrease their level of matrix metalloproteinase 9 secretion as well as increase syndecan-1 expression. Moreover, little Id-2 protein expression is detectable in human biopsies from aggressive and invasive carcinomas in comparison with in situ carcinomas. In conclusion, Id-2 expression not only follows a pattern opposite to that of Id-1 during mammary gland development and breast cancer progression but also appears to act as an important protein for the maintenance of a differentiated and noninvasive phenotype in normal and transformed breast cells.},

  abstract     = {{ID} proteins have been implicated in the regulation of cell proliferation and differentiation in various cell types during normal development as well as in the formation of cancer. Our aim was to delineate the expression of {ID}2 by immunohistochemistry in primary breast cancer in order to detect potential associations with cell cycle regulatory proteins and/or clinicopathologic parameters. We further overexpressed {ID}2 in a breast cancer cell line to elaborate potential effects on proliferation and invasiveness. We observed large variations in {ID}2 expression in primary breast cancer, and the protein was localised to both the nucleus and cytoplasm. Interestingly, a high cytoplasmic {ID}2 protein level correlated with a favourable prognosis. Overexpressing {ID}2 in the {MDA}-{MB}-468 breast cancer cell line generated a marked cytoplasmic localisation of the protein and reduced the invasive capacity of cells. Modest enhancement of cell proliferation was further detected in {ID}2-overexpressing cells. In conclusion, {ID}2 protein expression varies substantially within primary breast tumours and high cytoplasmic levels of {ID}2 might reflect a less aggressive breast tumour phenotype. © 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},
